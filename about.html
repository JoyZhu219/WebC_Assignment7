  					<h2>OUR CYBERNETIC LIVES</h2>
  					<p>The fact that we have ways of supplementing our own abilities by using artificial devices is a common feature of human life. One need only think of electronic devices such as cell phones to realise that our cognitive capacities are routinely enhanced by the use of human/artefact relationships.<br>I am still the moral agent whom people know and react to as me when I use my diary, and when I use my computer; I am myself over the telephone and when I benefit from my antidepressant medication, but how robust is this self who is me in the face of new cybernetic technology and its prospects for enhancement? Would I still be myself if my brain was largely driven by a device that simulated my young adult self in perpetuity?</p>

  					<p>We may find ourselves living at a frontier where all things are a matter of degree but then the human mind, released from a naive commitment to the finality of stereotypes and categorical judgments, has negotiated that kind of terrain before and done best when it has done so with humanity. On this basis, Hansie is one of us, not only because he is flesh and blood of the right kind, but also because he has not "died" in any culturally validated sense. He has, in terms of the experiences of his kith and kin, been severely injured and nursed back to health and he belongs, as a restored Hansie, to us in the same way as he always did.</p>

  					<p>We are left with the problem of Peggy, a problem bedevilled by the question: "What has happened to the real Peggy?" This problem keeps company with the thought that there is an android intelligence in Peggy who may be like a second personality?knowing but not known and ultimately able to perform a coup aided by a scheming cyborg, Andrea. This problem is an epistemic, metaphysical, psychological, and forensic conundrum but I would argue that the epistemic virtues needed to gather the data relevant to the metaphy sical question cannot be exercised in the absence of the right moral attitudes.</p>

  					<p>It therefore seems to me that a cyborg is, on the present account, as human as his or her life among us indicates to those who approach the encounter with an openness to others and a sense of life. The creature concerned ought then to be treated as such an acquaintance would treat them.</p>
